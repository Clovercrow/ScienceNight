        <p>Cosmic microwave background radiation, or CMB, is the oldest known light that telescopes can detect. They are milimeter size microwave radiations that are emitted from all directions, and can be found throughout the majority of the universe.</p>
        <p><strong>The Origin: </strong>CMB waves can be traced back to when the universe was 380,000 years old(the equivalent of a newborn). Though it is not definitively known how they came to be, the leading theory is that when the universe exploded into existance, light was created at extremely high temperatures. However, it wasn't until 380,000 years later that stable atoms first began to form. This event, called <strong>recombination</strong>, was the result of the universe expanding to the point of allowing electrons and nuclei to combine, which then allowed the newly created atoms to travel through a less dense space.     </p>
        <p><strong>Measurement: </strong>CMB is measured through a method called <strong>polarization</strong>. As can be observed in the image, CMB light is not uniform. The different colors represent different heat signatures, and within these different temperatures are waves known as anisotrophies which have different directions of vibration. Anisotrophies contain tiny relics of information about gases and temperatures which can allow astronomers to get a clearer image of the formation of galaxies, plants, and our universe.   </p>
        <p><strong>Discoveries: </strong> The discovery of CMB has been pinnacle to the understanding of the universe, as its existance has disproved many potential theories of how the universe was created. It has also proven the Big Bang Theory and other related theorums to be robust; when comapared to the information the anisotrophies displayed, they still held true. Through studying the gas signals present in the anisotrophies, astronomers can alsogain a better understanding of the beginnings of the universe. Information about the formation of planets, galaxies, and stars can be studied through the number, the proportions of, and the positions of the gases present in the light.   </p>
